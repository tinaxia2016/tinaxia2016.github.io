Hello, I'm Ji. Good to see you here!

<p align = "justify">
The general theme of my current research is to understand neural representation in V1 by analyzing and modeling high-dimensional neural data. 
<br>
<br>
Now I'm a physics PhD candidate from <a href="https://physics.wustl.edu/people/ralf-wessel">Ralf Wessel</a>'s lab in Washington University in St. Louis and about to graduate in 2021. 
Before that, I was trained in applied physics as an undergraduate student at Nankai University, China. 
<br>
<br>
Besides science, I also enjoy painting, music and playing board games with friends.
