Hello, I'm Ji. Good to see you here!

<img src="/assets/images/profile.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
<p align = "justify">
Currently, I'm a postdoc in <a href="https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/Ken">Ken Miller</a>'s group at Zuckerman Institute of Columbia University.  
<br>
<br>
Before that, I studied the neural representation in V1 by analyzing and modeling high-dimensional neural data in <a href="https://physics.wustl.edu/people/ralf-wessel">Ralf Wessel</a>'s lab at Washington University in St. Louis. 
Before that, I was trained in applied physics as an undergraduate student at Nankai University, China. 
<br>
<br>
Besides science, I also enjoy painting, music and playing board games with friends.
